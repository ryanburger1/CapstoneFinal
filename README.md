### Summary:
In this project I was asked to come up with a real life example of how machine learning could be implemented to solve a real world business problem. In today's society national travel predominantly comes in the form of airline travel and has in turn caused the airline industry to explode in revenue. One issue that faces many passengers on a daily basis is Flight Delays. They're inconvienent and often lose both the airline and customers money. To solve this issue I decided to build multiple machine learning models that can help airlines predict which flights may be delayed before they happen.

### Data:
I used data from the US DOT Bureau of Transportations domestic flight data (2009-2019) which was obtained through Kaggle.

Dataset used in my analysis:

### Notebooks:
* Link to my Final [Notebook](https://github.com/reboyce/CapstoneFinal/blob/main/FInal%20Analysis/Capstone-AirplaneDelayAnalysis.ipynb)
* Link to my Preprocessing [Notebooks](https://github.com/reboyce/CapstoneFinal/tree/main/Drafts)

### Modeling:
In my analysis I looked at predicting the variable "Delay" which was created by combing through the flights in the dataset and setting this binary variable to 1, or 0 if a flight experienced any sort of delay before, during, or after the flight. Because of the nature of this data I decided to work with algorithms that are best suited to handle binary classification problems. 
#### The models used in my analysis include:
* Logostic Regression 
* Random Forest
* XGboost
